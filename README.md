# Parse_MTL.py
##### Version 1.2.1

## Usage

1. Open Cinema 4D. 
2. Under the script menu, there's an option to open the script folder. Use that. 
3. Place Parse_MTL.py in that folder. 
4. You will probably need to restart C4D, but afterwards, goto "Script -> User Scripts -> Import .mtl file..."
5. Select the mtl file you wish to import.
6. The script will import the materials from the file.

## Credits

This is NOT my script. I merely edited a few lines in order to update an obsolete script.
The script comes from https://github.com/mredig/Parse-MTL-C4D, which itself took the code from another site that no longer exists
